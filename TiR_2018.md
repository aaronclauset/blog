# [](#header-1)Tenure in Review, 2010-2018
```1 January 2019```

My pre-tenure years as an Assistant Professor ran from 2010 to 2018 at the University of Colorado Boulder. In some ways, life as junior faculty is frenetic, and it can be easy to lose sight of trends or of events, once past. To get a more quantitative sense of what changed, by how much, and where things are going over this time, here's a look back at how my "year in review" numbers evolved over time [1]. Each of those annual summaries (like <a href="https://aaronclauset.github.io/2018_YiR">this one for 2018</a>) was presented largely without commentary, so I'll also take this opportunity to offer some more holistic but data-driven perspective they reveal on the pressures and privileges of modern faculty life.

### Publications (peer reviewed journals or competitive conferences):

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig1_pubs_2010-2018.png" alt="publications, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

The initial flatness of the cumulative blue line shows how my productivity stalled during my first two years as faculty (2010-2012): I published only <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053967">1 new paper</a>, and I remember how much time teaching consumed. In my first year, I developed a new <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/7000/">grad-level course on complex systems</a> (which later transformed into my <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/5352/">grad-level course on network science</a>) and I completely rebuilt our <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/5454/">grad-level algorithms course</a>. 

Once my research group was up and running and I could reuse my teaching materials, the pipeline started moving again, and it's evidently been pretty steady ever since. Although not a huge effect, the publication numbers in 2012 and 2015 do reflect my taking parental leave and substantially dialing-back my work time during those semesters. It's interesting to me that dip is not more noticeable, although it did have a larger effect on other efforts (see below).

In what should surprise no one in academia, my paper rejections consistently outpace my paper acceptances, at about 1.16 rejections per acceptance. Those rejections were unevenly spread across my papers -- some just took a lot of false starts before finding the right publication venue. Many of the rejections were from Computer Science conferences. Unlike most of my departmental colleagues, I didn't grow up publishing in a core set of CS conferences, meaning I had to learn how to write for them on my own, through trial and error. As new faculty, this felt like an obligation because I worried about how a publication record with no CS venues would look when I came up for tenure in a CS department, and I felt that my CS students would need CS publications when they went looking for jobs. Although it wasn't an easy path, pushing myself to publish in CS venues seemed to work---I did get tenure, and all of my students got jobs---but I have also come to loathe the CS conference model of peer review. I could say much more about why, but I'll save it for another day.

### Number of students in my research group:

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig9_group.png" alt="group size, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

I now counsel new faculty that they should try not to grow their research group too quickly: learning how to manage advisees doing research is itself something that takes practice. My own group grew very quickly in my second year, which led to lots of fun projects and produced many of my pre-tenure publications. But, it also stretched me more thinly than I would have liked and was pretty stressful. And yet, my group's size didn't peak until 2015-2017, when I advised 5-8 doctoral students, plus 1-3 postdocs, 1-2 masters students, and 1-4 undergraduates. That size was partly driven by my diverse research interests, and I'm happy that my group has included students from Computer Science, Applied Math, Evolutionary Biology, and Biochemistry. It also reflects, I think, an increased confidence in advising students from matriculation to graduation and in managing a diverse portfolio of projects with a diverse group of students.

Moving forward, though, I'll be aiming for a smaller group, which will be less stressful to manage, albeit one with fewer ongoing projects. That's okay with me, and I'm happy to have learned during my pre-tenure years what the "right sized" group is for me. I'm also excited about co-advising and collaborating with the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/research/complex-systems">half-dozen fantastic young faculty interested in complex systems</a>, and their students, that Colorado has hired during my pre-tenure years. [2]

### Annual new <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e7VI_HcAAAAJ&hl=en">citations</a> to past papers:

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig2_cites.png" alt="new citations, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

Not much to say here except that it's both humbling and gratifying to see that other researchers find my work useful and relevant, and that the new citations to my papers increased each year over my pre-tenure years. The plot also shows the annual new citation count for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062">my most cited paper</a>, which has had a ridiculous level of impact, and is a (thankfully) shrinking share of my overall citations.

### Research talks and popular press pieces:

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig3_talks_n_press.png" alt="talks and press, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

In total, I gave roughly 100 research talks as an Assistant Professor, or about one talk per month, every month, for 8 years. The popular press line covers instances where my research was written about by someone else, sometimes in the news, sometimes on a blog. I'm not sure what happened after 2015, but that was the first year I started publishing on <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/1/e1400005">the role of faculty in the "science of science,"</a> and on their career patterns.

### Work as a reviewer or editor: 

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig4_reviewing.png" alt="reviewing work, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

During my first few years, as I struggled to balance non-research demands with research, I was counseled that I was doing too much work as a reviewer. That was probably true, but that load hasn't really let up over the years. I did subsequently decline a greater fraction of invitations (from 50% up to about 75%), but that was mainly because more invitations were coming in (peaking in 2014 with more than 100) [3].

A major transition occurred in 2015, my first year as a full-time Associate Editor at <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/"><i>Science Advances</i></a> (the open access sister of <i>Science</i>). I was also counseled not to take that job, but did anyway. I felt I could help make Science Advances a home for high-quality interdisciplinary work, which might struggle to find a good home elsewhere in the disciplinary scientific ecosystem. Another transition occurred in 2017, when Science Advances asked me to become the Deputy Editor (DE) responsible for all social and interdisciplinary submissions, managing a group of 10 Associate Editors spanning Anthropology, Computer Science, Economics, Network Science, Psychology, Sociology, and Statistics, and a bit of Computational Biology. This work doesn't even fit on the above graph: in the 18 months I've been a DE, I've handled nearly 1000 submissions, most of which were returned without review.

This work has been stimulating (the breadth of submissions is enormous, and I've especially enjoyed the archaeology papers), tiring, and also gratifying. Looking back now, I think the journal has, in many ways, become what I hoped it would become [4], and we've published dozens of papers I think are exceptional contributions to science. I don't know how much longer I'll be able to balance the DE work with being an active scientist, but I do hope to further establish the journal as a good home for strong computational work, especially in the social sciences. There's a lot more I could say about my experience as an editor and how my perspective has evolved on the role of journals in academia and the different models of peer review, but I'll save that for another day.

### Grant proposals:

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig5_grants.png" alt="grants, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

Alongside the teaching pressure in my first few years, I also submitted a ridiculous number of grant proposals, some of which were for young investigator fellowships with narrow eligibility windows. (Starting in 2010, my PhD was already 4 years old.) I also remember feeling that writing successful proposals would take a lot of practice that I hadn't gotten previously (I'd helped write one, to a private foundation, as a postdoc), and that I'd probably face a more difficult-than-normal path because of the strongly interdisciplinary style of my research, which didn't fit naturally into any core federal funding program. I don't think I was wrong about those concerns, but the amount of time I spent on this aspect of the job surely took time away from other things.

My big breakthroughs were a large DARPA grant and a small NIH grant in 2012, and since then I've felt more confident both that I could write good proposals and that I had a better sense of what grant competitions to apply to. (It helped also that I sat on four NSF panels and attended a CAREER award writing workshop.) Since 2010, I've been lucky enough to receive, along with my co-investigators, grants from DARPA, NIH, and NSF, plus a few small grants from private foundations and companies, totaling around $4,500,000. But, I've also come to believe that competing for grants consumes a stupid amount of precious time, does poorly at allocating funding to projects in an equitable way, and I am genuinely uncertain about how this part of my job will evolve in the long-term. tl;dr: I'm not sure I can keep this up for another 30 years.

### Email:

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig6_email.png" alt="emails, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

The volume of emails I send and receive has literally doubled over my pre-tenure years, and I really do spend a lot more time on email now than I did as a brand new professor. It's hard to wrap my head around having received nearly 25,000 emails in 2018, all of which I looked at. If this trend keeps up, I'll receive something like 45,000 emails in 2040.

The sent-mail volume is increasing at a slower pace, meaning that I reply to a shrinking fraction of emails I receive. Suddenly, it makes sense why senior faculty have such terrible response rates to emails... And, I attribute the big dip in my 2018 sent-mail to my sabbatical auto-response, which some of you may have gotten. The mental freedom that auto-response has created is enormous, and I'll be a little sad when I have to turn it off in August 2019.

### Songs and music:

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig7_photos.png" alt="photos and music, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

Something happened in 2012 that fundamentally changed the rate at which I take photos, but didn't do much to my music acquisition habits. Oh right, it was having kids. The dashed line shows the pre-kid trend extrapolated out to 2018, revealing a roughly 8000 photo "surplus" due to having children. This rate will probably slow down eventually, but if it didn't, by 2040, I'll have crossed 60,000 photos. How do you even begin to sort or browse that many photos?

### Travel:

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig8_travel.png" alt="travel, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

The years in which my children were born are clear dips in my work travel, which reflect choices I made about my time during parental leave. On the other hand, 2010, 2013, and 2014 seem notably busy, but I honestly don't remember why. As a younger academic, I loved travel, especially international trips. But as my pre-tenure years progressed, the sheen wore off; trips are stressful for my family, and work-life balance has become more important to me. It's comforting that the family trips line is so stable across time, despite requiring a conscious effort to maintain.

### Looking back, looking forward:

Pre-tenure years are about figuring out how to sustainably balance the many competing demands of being a professor, while producing a steady stream of useful scholarship. These are stressful years, not just because of the high demands, but also because there's no universal guidebook for how to succeed. These years are a trial run: if you can figure out, mostly on your own, how to balance research, teaching, and service, do these things well, and feel good about doing them, then you could probably do this job for 30 more years. That's what it means to be tenured. In the end, there are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/44/E9216">many ways to be successful</a>. In my own data, I see different parts of the story of my pre-tenure struggles and successes. And, I'm glad that Colorado decided I had been successful enough, in their terms, to be awarded tenure and the opportunity to keep going.

It's cliche to say that being a professor is more like a marathon than a sprint, but it's true. And having run my first marathon in 2018, I can say it's also true that if you're only used to running 5 or maybe 10 miles, you have little sense of what it means to run the full 26.2 at a competitive pace. Perhaps the marathon analogy is deeper than most people realize, or just deeper than I realized before running an actual marathon. Now that I've finished this first marathon, I know for sure that I do like running and I'm not bad at it, so long as I can do it largely on my own terms and explore what I want.

After reading a draft of this post, a friend asked me whether I thought I might have been able to get tenure with less effort than the data here suggest. I'm honestly not sure, as it's a tricky counter-factual to consider and I haven't seen enough tenure cases myself to get a sense of how the bar is parameterized. But... I suspect the answer is probably yes. I probably overshot and could have written somewhat fewer papers, given somewhat fewer talks, done less reviewing, etc. and still been awarded tenure. Why didn't I? The answer is complicated. Partly, it's because I felt like everything I was doing was worthwhile. But, I was also genuinely worried about being penalized for not behaving like a conventional computer scientist [5]. In the end, the votes were unanimous at each level of the tenure evaluation, but I take away from this experience a desire to make Colorado a more supportive environment for truly interdisciplinary work, to the extent that I can.

Some time in the year I was up for tenure, I felt a visceral shift in my perspective on being faculty [6]. I started thinking about what new kinds of challenges I might want to try, since evidently, I was decent enough at the basics: publishing papers, teaching courses, raising money, etc. I'm still working through the mental freedom that's come with that shift, and I'm excited to explore some of the new directions that seem to be opening up now that I've crossed this threshold. I'll say more about some of them another day.

One clear privilege of being a professor is the flexibility to set your own agenda and schedule, within limits. The tradeoff is the enormous pressure to publish papers, fundraise, graduate students, teach, and help run your department, university, and broader research community. I tell my students that few careers offer the kind of intellectual freedom that faculty have, to study basically whatever they think is interesting. For me, that freedom has been valuable and fulfilling, and, so far, worth the opportunity cost of not working in industry, making easily 2-3x my faculty salary for solving probably less intellectually stimulating problems. And, I feel incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to make real contributions to so many distinct scientific fields, including fun projects on wacky topics like the sizes of whales, global patterns in terrorism, the likelihood of large wars, and the epistemology of complex systems. I enjoy teaching students to find joy in mental work, to see complexity as a challenge to confront with science, to think carefully and causally about complex systems, and to contribute to the grand human adventure that is science. And, I enjoy making discoveries, building new methods for solving hard problems, and shaping the direction of science. These are fulfilling aspects of the job. 

There are also many aspects of being a professor that I dislike, and there have been many times since 2010 that I thought about quitting [7]. I have complete respect for my colleagues who have made the decision to leave, and completely support my students who seek industry positions after they graduate. The top thing I dislike about academia is that there is simply too much to do, too many demands and pressures. As a result, it can be difficult to clearly see the successes, and it's easy to feel spread too thin. For me, looking back at the data is a useful way to see those successes, in aggregate, and to reflect on what went well and what could have been different. My pre-tenure years were incredibly intense, educational, and productive. I'm particularly proud of a number of papers I helped produce, and I'm immensely proud of the hard work and contributions of my students.

Looking forward, there are several long-running research projects and several big new teaching projects I'm involved in that I'm excited to see play out. It'll also be fun to write another of these by-the-numbers retrospectives in another 8 years, to see how things have continued or changed as a tenured Associate Professor. Onward.

[1] Eagle-eyed readers might notice that some of these numbers don't line up exactly with my past year-in-review summaries. For some of these, I went back through the raw data to correct some mistakes or ambiguities, so these numbers are a more accurate picture than any individual summary.

[2] That was no accident! One of my main service efforts for Colorado during my pre-tenure years was faculty hiring. The various searches I ran or participated in hired a total of eight new faculty from 2013-2017.

[3] The journals I have declined the most over the years are <i>Physica A</i> followed by <i>Scientific Reports</i>, both published by for-profit organizations that I think academia would be better off without.

[4] Although I loathe impact factors, the first one Science Advances received was 11.51. For reference, the impact factor of PNAS, another general science journal, is 10.36.

[5] It's <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0001839216665364">well documented</a> that academia <a href="https://items.ssrc.org/the-perks-and-perils-of-interdisciplinary-research/">imposes a penalty</a> on work and people who <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18315">don't fit neatly into disciplinary categories or patterns</a>, and there were enough local signals to make me genuinely concerned about it, despite other reassurances. It didn't help when the department chair told me that because my research was so interdisciplinary, they were unsure how they would identify outside letter writers for my tenure case.

[6] This shift was like the one I felt when I transitioned from a postdoc to faculty. As a graduate student and postdoc, I was always on a time limit with projects, because those positions are inherently short-term. In my first few years as faculty, I felt my planning horizon recede into the future. Conceivably, I could start work on a question that could take 5, 10, or even more years to finish. That shift pushed me to think differently about which research questions I wanted to pursue, and I started thinking about bigger and deeper questions, ones that might not be answerable without years of effort.

[7] Obviously, I haven't followed through. I don't think of myself as an academic "lifer", and so far, it's been a net positive experience.
