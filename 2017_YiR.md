[1] Sometime in 2017, the software that ran my old <a href="http://cs.unm.edu/~aaron/blog/">Structure+Strangeness blog</a> failed. The IT guys in the <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu">CS department at UNM</a> had generously kept it running for the 11 years since I graduated, basically maintaining a server that no one else used. Its time has now also passed, and so my old blog will be forever frozen at the end of 2016 [2]. It was born in January 2005, two years before I would graduate, and lived a fruitful life. It helped me find my own scientific voice. It helped my writing. It helped me work through ideas, some interesting, some less so. And, it gave me a place to write things that definitely wouldn't fit in a tweet or a thread or a paper.


[2] An eventuality that seemed likely for 2017, <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~aaron/blog/archives/2016/12/2016_a_year_in.htm">back at the end of 2016</a>.
