# Structure + Strangeness

The current home for my long-form but non-academic writing. Thoughts about science, academia, networks, peer review, journals, artificial intelligence, complexity, computational social science, computational biology, etc. *Structure+Strangeness* has always been a place for thinking aloud and a place for storing public artifacts. The name comes from a chapter in the book version of [Douglas Hofstadter's *Metamagical Themas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamagical_Themas), which stirred my imagination as a young teenager, and got me excited about complex systems, mathematics, and the mysterious of science. From 2004-2017, I maintained a blog called [*Structure+Strangeness* blog](http://www.cs.unm.edu/~aaron/blog/), which I started as a doctoral student and actively used mainly through my postdoc years.
