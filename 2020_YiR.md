Here's to 2020 being over, and to hoping that 2021 is better.

[1] COVID-19 has caused so much loss this year. Although I'm hopeful for what widespread vaccination will restore, the loss of human life and wellbeing is really staggering. But I can't write off 2020 completely, because I was also on parental leave in the Fall. Looking back, this year has deepened my respect for and interest in good medicine, and my appreciation for family.
