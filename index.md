# Structure + Strangeness

The current home for my very occasional, long-form, non-academic writing. Thoughts about science, academia, networks, peer review, journals, artificial intelligence, complexity, computational social science, computational biology, etc. *Structure+Strangeness* has always been a place for thinking aloud and a place for storing public artifacts. The name comes from a chapter in the book version of [Douglas Hofstadter's *Metamagical Themas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamagical_Themas), which stirred my imagination as a young teenager fascinated by math and logic. It also got me excited about complex systems, mathematics, and the mysteries of science.

From 2004-2017, I maintained a regular blog called [*Structure+Strangeness* blog](http://www.cs.unm.edu/~aaron/blog/), which I started as a doctoral student and actively updated throughout my postdoc years. Faculty life proved too busy to keep it up at the same level, and now as senior faculty, I have only a little time for it. Most of my opining about science is done on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/aaronclauset.bsky.social), or in a more pedagogical form to my research group and classroom students.

## Data on Paid Parental Leave Policies
```11 April 2018```

We assembled an [open data set of paid parental leave policies](https://aaronclauset.github.io/parental-leave/) for 205 universities in the U.S. and Canada. To facilitate exploration and comparison, we put together a neat interactive visualization, and did a few quick statistical analyses. Joint work with [Allison C. Morgan](https://allisonmorgan.github.io), [Samuel F. Way](http://samfway.com), [Mirta Galesic](https://sites.google.com/site/mirtagalesic/), and [Daniel B. Larremore](https://larremorelab.github.io).
