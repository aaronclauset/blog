# Structure + Strangeness

The current home for my long-form but non-academic writing. Thoughts about science, academia, networks, peer review, journals, artificial intelligence, complexity, computational social science, computational biology, etc. *Structure+Strangeness* has always been a place for thinking aloud and a place for storing public artifacts. The name comes from a chapter in the book version of [Douglas Hofstadter's *Metamagical Themas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamagical_Themas), which stirred my imagination as a young teenager, and got me excited about complex systems, mathematics, and the mysterious of science. From 2004-2017, I maintained a blog called [*Structure+Strangeness* blog](http://www.cs.unm.edu/~aaron/blog/), which I started as a doctoral student and actively used mainly through my postdoc years.

## Data on Paid Parental Leave Policies
```11 April 2018```

We assembled an [open data set of paid parental leave policies](https://aaronclauset.github.io/parental-leave/) for 205 universities in the U.S. and Canada. To facilitate exploration and comparison, we put together a neat interactive visualization, and did a few quick statistical analyses. Joint work with [Allison C. Morgan](https://allisonmorgan.github.io), [Samuel F. Way](http://samfway.com), [Mirta Galesic](https://sites.google.com/site/mirtagalesic/), and [Daniel B. Larremore](https://larremorelab.github.io).
